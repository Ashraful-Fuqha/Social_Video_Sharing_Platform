# Project Overview
## Social A Video Sharing Platform

This project is a video sharing platform built using modern web technologies. The platform allows users to sign up, log in, and access a home page where they can interact with video content. The frontend is developed using React, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit for state management. For API calls and data fetching, RTK Query is utilized. The backend is powered by MongoDB, Express, Multer, Cloudinary, JWT tokens, and Mongoose.

## Features
